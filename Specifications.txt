Memory Game Requirements

Summary:

  Players will be shown a collection of cards, face down, and can click on a card to reveal whatâ€™s underneath. 
  After clicking on two cards, the game should check to see whether they match. 
    If they do, they will remain facing up. 
    If not, the cards should remain displayed to the player for a couple of seconds, and then flip back down. 
  The goal of the game is to match up pairs of cards in as few clicks as possible.

Specifications:

  User should be able to START a new game.
  
  Click card -> reveal what's underneath it.

  Track and display number of times cards have been turned over.

  User should only be able to see at most two cards at a time. (Not counting former matches...)

  Clicking on two matching cards = "match" -> those two cards should stay face up. (Make sure doesn't work if just click same card twice)

  Clicking on two non-matching cards -> should remain visible for at least 1 second before flipping back over.

  Bonus: Store  lowest-scoring game in local storage, so user can see record of best game played.


TASKS:

  Game Board:
    XX__Build grid
    XX__Make cards
      XX__Flippable
        XX__Transforms
        Xx__Event listeners (and handlers, though runs into game logic)
      XX__Certain number of matching cards
      XX__Source images
    XX__Randomly assign cards to grid
    00__Counter HTML/CSS/JS
    00__Basic start button

  Game logic:
    XX__Game start condition: click Start button.
    XX__Main Logic:
          Click -> 
            ++ counter,
            First or second click?
              First: keep card up til second
              Second: 
                if match, keep first and second flipped permanently; (via checking image source?)
                else, keep both visible 1 second, then flip back. (not letting other cards be flipped til flipped back...)
          Game end condition: all cards flipped.
    (Game end scene...?)

    Local Storage

    Image array :
      [1: src1, 2: src2, 3: src3...]
    forLoop, math.random choosing index from image array, splice out that element & clone it & put them in prepArray, decrement forLoop counter

    prepArray: original and clone of X number of images to use
      [1: src1, 2: src1, 3: src2, 4: src2...]
      or
      [1: {src: src1, cardID: 1}, 2: {src: src1, cardID: 1}, 3: {src: src2, cardID: 2}...]
    forLoop, math.random choosing index from prepArray, splice out element, push to cardArray (or directly append to grid), decrement forLoop

    cardArray: actual ordered list of cards to be put in grid
    forLoop, append to grid, give data-card-index



    Matching: check either img src, OR check data-card-id
