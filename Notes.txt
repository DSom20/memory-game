CSS Grid- responsive items/cells
    --Remaining questions:
        a) honestly,  still don't get what percentages in either g-t-c or grid-item's max/min-width refer to.  I think i do for a sec, then I try something else which breaks my understanding all over again
        b) related to (a), don't fully know how g-t-c auto works... seems to work differently when placed in min vs max...
    --Some findings though:

    1) Set grid display : inline-grid  (!!)
       OR set a grid container to inline-block

    2) to define max cell size via grid (or grid container) max-width, set that max-width in px, then
        .grid {
            grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(50px,auto));
        }

        .grid-item {
            width: calc((100vmin - 40*3px) / 3);
            min-width: 100%; 
            max-width: 100%;
        }
    
    3) To instead define cell size regardless of grid size (ie, have grid size solely determined by its cells) :

        /* 2 options: */
        /* 1a:
            -- Grid determines minmax
            -- Grid-item determines in-between, just sets min/max-widths at 100%, equalling what was set in Grid's gtc minmax
            ---Problem: makes grid no longer height-change responsive, just width-change
        //////////
        .grid {
            grid-template-columns: repeat(3,minmax(50px,200px));
        }

        .grid-item {
            width: calc((100vmin - 40*3px) / 3);
            min-width: 100%;
            max-width: 100%;
        }
        /////////

            1b:
              -- Fix 1a problem by setting grid max to auto; grid-item max-width to px not %;
              -- (Don't do just grid min auto and grid max as px --> grid item can get smaller than grid cell...
                    AND max px only matters with width-change, height-change could effectively take cells/items past max px...)
        
        .grid {
            grid-template-columns: repeat(3,minmax(50px,auto));
        }

        .grid-item {
            width: calc((100vmin - 40*3px) / 3);
            min-width: 100%;
            max-width: 200px;
        }
